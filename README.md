This file was created by Dorian Benitez to satisfy the requirements of Homework 1 for CS 4375.001. 

The HW1_DorianBenitez.cpp file should be stored in a folder with a CSV file named "Boston.csv", which should be composed of two columns, one being titled "rm" and the other being titled "medv". Once a folder is setup with both the "HW1_DorianBenitez.cpp" file and the "Boston.csv" file, it is ready for execution. 

To run the program, enter your command line and enter the following commands:

	g++ HW1_DorianBenitez.cpp
	./a.out

The program shall execute and will only throw an error if there is an issue when reading the CSV file.
